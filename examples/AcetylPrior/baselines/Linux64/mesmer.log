In He: He copied from ../../librarymols.xml
In R1: Parsing reaction...Irreversible unimolecular reaction
In acetyl: Prior:ExcessEnergy was given a range with 4 steps 
In AceticAcid: No value of me:ZPE was supplied and the default value NEEDS TO BE CHECKED**
In acetyl: The default value of me:energyTransferModel was used.
In TSdecomp: The default value of the attribute spinMultiplicity was used.
In R1: No tunneling method used for R1
In R1: No crossing method used for R1
In R2: Parsing reaction...Bimolecular sink reaction
In R2: Reading parameters for Reaction R2 which uses the SimpleBimolecularSink method
In R2: No tunneling method used for R2
In R2: No crossing method used for R2
In R2: Not a unimolecular reaction: look for excess reactant concentration.
All molecules are on the same energy basis: arbitary
