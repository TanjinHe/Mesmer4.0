In R1: Parsing reaction...Association reaction
In Methyl: Methyl:ZPE was given a range with 3 steps 
In H: The default value of the attribute spinMultiplicity was used.
In H: The default value of me:DOSCMethod was used.
In Methane: The default value of me:DistributionCalcMethod was used.
In Methane: Methane:deltaEDown was given a range with 15 steps 
In TS1: No imaginary vibrational frequency. Check if there is tunneling.
Cannot find me:vibFreqs or me:hessian. Assuming an atom or a sink molecule.
In TS1: No rotational constants from <me:rotConsts> or structure. Assuming an atom or a sink molecule.
In TS1: The default value of me:DOSCMethod was used.
In TS1: The default attribute(s) were added to the the property me:ZPE
In TS1: TS1:ZPE will be derived from Methyl:ZPE. Check below that this has been found.
In R1: No tunneling method used for R1
In R1: No crossing method used for R1
In R1: Not a unimolecular reaction: look for excess reactant concentration.
