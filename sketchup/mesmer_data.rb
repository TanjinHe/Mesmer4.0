# The function of this script is to use SketchUp as an interface to manipulate
# and visualize MESMER XML documents, which includes the following
# functionalities:
# 1. Read and visualize MESMER single or multiple SketchUp files.
#   a. PES
#   b. DOS
#   c. k(E)s in grains and possibly cells
#   d. Bartis-Widom rates and species profile
#   e. grid search and fitting results
#   All above both shown in 2D and 3D, which can be achieved by using
#   SketchUp "Scenes".
# 2. Provide a set of UI's for entering data and save to inidividual XML files.
#    This includes an array of file names and an array of target models.
#    The data can include:
#   a. molecular definitions (atoms, coordinates, vibrational frequencies, etc.)
#   b. reaction schemes
#   c. conditions
#   d.
