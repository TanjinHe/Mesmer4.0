Introduction
------------

The program is named MESMER, which stands for Master Equation Solver for Multi-Energy well Reactions. 
It is is capable of solving the energy grained master equation (EGME) for a unimolecular system composed of an arbitrary 
number of wells, transition states, sinks, and reactants.
ollowing features are provided in this program:
1. Use standard XML data representation as input stream, in which comments are easily inserted/removed to assist human readability. 
2. Open source C++ codes, that can be compiled on most plateforms. 
3. References are given in proper positions where the methodologies are used.
4. MESMER is released with a GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, see license.txt.

Installation
------------

-- Install libraries
QD: The installation of library qd has to be made to the system default directory, 
which is "/usr/local" for many UNIX/Linux systems. To install qd on your platform 
please follow the direction of the file INSTALL in the qd directory.
