  <h1>Adding molecules to the library</h1>
   <p>Mesmer has a library to contain data for common molecules. If a molecule is in the library, it needs to be specified in the &lt;moleculeList&gt; section of the project's XML file only by its id, for example:</p>
    <pre>    &lt;molecule id="OH"/&gt;  </pre>
   <p>When it runs, Mesmer will copy the version from the library and add information to the project datafile to confirm this.</p>
   <p>The library is a CML file <code>librarymols.xml</code>. The following shows how to add data to it, taken from a NIST website. Of course you can add molecules to your own data files in essentially the same way.

  <h2>From computational chemistry files</h2>

  <p>A large collection of Gaussian files are available at <a href="http://cccbdb.nist.gov"> http://cccbdb.nist.gov</a>. The procedure is illustrated for dimethyl ether from this source.</p>

  <p>Select "VI Input and output files", "A. Input and Output from runs using the Gaussian package". On the next screen enter "CH3OCH3" and then select "Dimethyl ether". Choose a method and basis-set and download an output file (Save Link As...), making its filename the your choice of the molecule's ID, e.g. DME.out. (The ID iscase-sensitive.)</p>

     <p>
       <a href="http://openbabel.org">OpenBabel</a> (v2.3.1 or later) is used to convert to CML.
       (Prior to the release of this version, there is a Windows Installer for a snapshot
       <a href="http://gaseq.co.uk/OB/OpenBabel2.3.90_Windows_Installer.exe"> here</a>.)</p>
       <p><em>Using the GUI</em><br/>
       Select "out -- Generic Output file format" as the input format and cml -- "Chemical Markup Language" as the output format. Near the bottom of the input column, tick the checkboxes "write metadata", "omit XML and namespace declarations" and "write properties" and then click Convert.
     </p>
    <em>Using the command line</em><br/>
    On Windows, open a DOS window and move to the folder where DME.out was downloaded, and type</p>
  <pre>    obabel DME.out -O DME.cml -xp -xm -xx  </pre>
  <p>The <code>-xp</code>  and <code>-xm</code> ensure that the CML file contains molecular properties and metadata, and the <code>-xx</code> omits the xml header.</p>
  <p>
  Although Mesmer does not use it, some editing of the metadata in this file is recommended. Identify the source and the person who downloaded it:</p>
  <pre>    &lt;metadata name="dc:source" content="http://cccbdb.nist.gov/"/&gt;
    &lt;metadata name="dc:contributor" content="Chris Morley"/&gt;  </pre>
  <p>and you might like to add a more explanatory title:</p>
  <pre>    &lt;metadata name="dc:title" content="Dimethyl Ether CH3OCH3"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>Copy the whole file and paste it into librarymols.xml just before the final tag (&lt;/moleculeList&gt; or &lt;/cml&gt;).</p>
  
  <p>The energy that is imported in the property with <code>dictRef="me:ZPE"</code> is the 'equilibrium' energy at the bottom of the well and so also has the attribute <code>zeroPointVibEnergyAdded="false"</code>. Mesmer will automatically add the vibrational zeropoint energy before use. If this is inconvenient, the number should be corrected manually and the attribute deleted.</p>


  <h2>From experimental data</h2>

  <p>The site at <a href="http://cccbdb.nist.gov">http://cccbdb.nist.gov</a> also contains experimental data. An OpenBabel format has been written to assist in converting this. Otherwise, an existing molecule in librarymols.xml can be copied and manually edited.</p>

  <p>Select "II. Experimental data", "1. All experimental data for one molecule".   Choose a molecule.</p>

  <p>The raw text from the  next screen (which has all the data) is used as input to OpenBabel. Right click and choose Select  All, right click again and choose Copy.</p>
 
 <p>The text could be pasted into an editor and saved as a file, but it is also possible to paste it directly into the OpenBabel GUI.  Select the input format "cccdbd" and check the "Input below" checkbox and paste the copied text into the yellow textbox.</p> 

  <p>Choose "cml" for the output format have "Output below(no outputfile)" checked. At the bottom of the middle section, also check "write metadata", "omit XML and namespace declarations" and "write properties".  Click "Convert"</p>
 
  <p>Paste all the output into librarymols.xml just before the final tag. The metadata should be edited as in the previous section. Adding units and a dictRef to the enthalpy at 0K is also necessary:</p>
  <pre>    &lt;property title="Hf0" dictRef="me:Hf0"&gt;
      &lt;scalar units="kJ/mol"&gt;5.03&lt;/scalar&gt;
    &lt;/property>  </pre>
  <p>If the OpenBabel GUI is not used, the command line would be something like:</p>
  <pre>    obabel -i cccbdb  copied.txt  -o cml  -xp -xm -xx  </pre>

  <h2>Record any modifications</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Should any modification of the molecule be necessary, either in <code>librarymols.xml</code> or in a normal MESMER datafile, it is recommended to add an element for each modification like:

  <pre>    &lt;me:edit by="Chris Morley" date="21110105"&gt;changed Hf0 to 5.04&lt;/me:edit&gt;  </pre>
  </li>
  <li>If you want to use a library molecule but with an id different from the one in the library, add an element at the top of <code>librarymols.xml</code>
  <pre>    &lt;molecule id="yourid" ref="libraryid"/&gt;  </pre></li>
  <li>Molecules in <code>librarymols.xml</code> with an attribute <code>active="false"</code> are ignored. This can be used to temporarily deactivate an entry without deleting it, while trying a new version.</li>
  </ul>
